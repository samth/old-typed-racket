TypedScheme: alpha release

The TypedScheme programming language, a dialect of PLT Scheme
with static type checking, is now available from PLaneT. The
language is explicitly typed and supports some polymorphism. Its
type system is designed to support the common Scheme programming
style, as used in The Little LISPer/Schemer or How to Design
Programs.

This alpha release consists of a functional core language with
typed definitions of all kinds, including variables, functions
and structures as well as some polymorphism.

We expect the language to include imperative constructs in the
near future.
